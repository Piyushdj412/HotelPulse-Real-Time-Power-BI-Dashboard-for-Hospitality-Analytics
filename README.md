üìä HotelPulse ‚Äì Real-Time Power BI Dashboard for Hospitality Analytics
Welcome to HotelPulse, a real-time analytics dashboard created to provide meaningful insights for the Travel & Hospitality industry using Power BI. This project showcases my capability as a Data Analyst to handle large datasets (100K+ rows), clean and transform messy data, and design insightful dashboards that communicate key metrics clearly to decision-makers.


üîç Project Overview
Domain: Travel & Hospitality
Dataset Size: 100,000+ rows (synthetic & uncleaned)
Tech Stack: Power BI, DAX, Power Query, Microsoft Excel

This end-to-end data analytics project is built to demonstrate the process of:

- Ingesting a large, complex dataset

- Cleaning and transforming it for analysis

- Building custom DAX measures

- Designing KPI-focused dashboards

- Extracting actionable business insights

The dashboard simulates a real-world scenario where hotel management wants to track and analyze booking performance, customer trends, and profitability across different regions, room types, and time frames.


üß© Key Contributions
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled nulls, outliers, and inconsistent formats in columns like:

price_per_night (string/numeric mix)

discount, nights_stayed (missing/erroneous values)

age (incomplete entries)

Used Power Query to:

Replace nulls with statistically meaningful values

Convert date formats and calculate day types (Weekday/Weekend)

Create a custom calendar table for time intelligence


2. Data Modeling & DAX Calculations
Established relationships between fact and dimension tables

Used DAX to create 15+ calculated measures including:

- Total Revenue

- ADR (Average Daily Rate)

- RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)

- Occupancy Rate

- Customer Retention %

- Ratings Analysis

- Weekend vs Weekday Revenue


3. Dashboard Design
The dashboard is designed to be interactive, insightful, and easy to navigate, with visual components including:

KPI Cards for key metrics like Revenue, Bookings, ADR


Line & Bar Charts for time trends and regional comparisons

Slicers for filtering by region, room type, customer segment, booking channel, and date range

Matrix Visuals for comparative metrics across categories


üìà Insights & Business Value
- Revenue increased by 27% on weekends compared to weekdays

- Premium rooms contributed to 15% more revenue than standard rooms

- Highest customer retention observed in loyalty program members

- Seasonal trends indicate peak booking months and low occupancy periods

- These insights can help hotel managers optimize pricing strategies, improve customer engagement, and forecast occupancy for resource planning.


üéØ What I Learned
- Applying end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes in Power BI

- Crafting scalable and reusable DAX measures

- Performing time-based and customer-segmented analytics

- Designing business-friendly dashboards that tell a story

- Making data-driven decisions based on real-time visuals
